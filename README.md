# Juniper Network Devices Simulation Tool

## Overview

This project aims to create a simulation tool for Juniper network devices, similar to Cisco Packet Tracer. The tool will allow users to practice basic and advanced configurations on virtual Juniper devices.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) to design and visualize network topologies
- Support for basic and advanced Juniper network configurations
- Real-time simulation of network behavior
- Integration with Juniper's CLI for configuration
- Save and load network topology and configuration files

## Components

1. **GUI**: A graphical interface to design and visualize network topologies.
2. **Backend**: A simulation engine to mimic the behavior of Juniper devices.
3. **CLI Integration**: Integration with Juniper's CLI for configuring devices.
4. **File Management**: Save and load network topology and configuration files.
